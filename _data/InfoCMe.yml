  description: >
    Investigating the annual cycle of this species (determining staging sites, non-breeding sites, and migratory schedule)
    Which factors affect the individual variation in migration strategies?
      . weather along the migration route and at the breeding ground
      . individual brood performance
      . population dynamic at the breeding site
      . genetic variation between individuals
    How do migration strategies differ between populations?
