  description: >
    Felix is an ecologist with broad interests, but a particular focus on bird migration. He has 
    been fascinated for more than 30 years in using modern technology like radar and miniaturized 
    data-loggers to investigate animal movements that are otherwise invisible. Felix leads the Bird 
    Migration Department at the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/) 
    and is a senior adviser within GloBAM.

- name: Silke Bauer
  role: Project coordinator / Leader - Synthesis (WP5)
  image: assets/img/Team/Silke_Bauer.jpg
  description: >
    Animal migrations, especially their large scale patterns and timing are Silke’s core research 
    interest. Although much of her research has been devoted to migrants and migrations themselves, 
    it increasingly also recognizes that migrants can have a multitude of effects and interact with 
    the resident communities visited during their journeys. Silke is a senior researcher at the 
    [Swiss Ornithological institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/), GloBAM’s coordinator and 
    lead of its synthesis-parts.

- name: Tom Mason
  role: Post-doctoral researcher
  image: assets/img/Team/Tom_Mason.jpg
  description: >
    Tom is a conservation ecologist interested in how wild animal populations respond to changes in
    their environment. He works as a post-doctoral researcher within the Bird Migration Department
    of the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/). Within GloBAM, Tom
    will focus on developing spatial models of bird migration to explore how migratory journeys
    will be affected by global environmental change.

    Investigating the annual cycle of this species (determining staging sites, non-breeding sites, and migratory schedule)
    Which factors affect the individual variation in migration strategies?
      . weather along the migration route and at the breeding ground
      . individual brood performance
      . population dynamic at the breeding site
      . genetic variation between individuals
    How do migration strategies differ between populations?
